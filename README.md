# Employee Leave Management System (Full Project)

This archive contains a full-stack sample project (backend + frontend) matching the Employee Leave Management System spec.
backend : npm install -> node seed.js -> npm run
frontend : npm install -> npm run
Seed manager: run `node seed.js` in `backend` to create a sample manager (manager@example.com / password123).



Frontend may not work properly :(
